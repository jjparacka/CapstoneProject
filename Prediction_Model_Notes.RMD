## Prediction accuracy and performance for models 
A sample of 20 tweets and 20 blogs are selected for performance and accuracy measurement. Using each sentence from the tweet and blogs a prediction is made for the last word of the sentence. This prediction(s) are compared to the actual word from the sentence to measure the accuracy. 

We try out different models to find the right combination for accuracy and performance. 

## Baseline prediction 
The base line prediction is just using the most common words "The", "on" and "a" as the predictions. The developed model should have significantly higher accuracy than this.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
